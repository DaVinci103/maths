	<h1>Sets and Functions</h1>
	<h2>Sets</h2>
	<p>
		In mathematics, a <b>set</b> refers to any collection of objects. For example, there is a set of natural numbers $\NN$, a set of all people on earth, a set with no elements, and a set consisting of a triangle, the colour red and a sheep named Gregory. Sets are often denoted with curly braces $\{\cdots\}$ with the contents of the set between them. So, for example, the last set listed is denoted as $\{\triangle, \red{\bullet}, \textrm{Gregory the sheep}\}$. We'll denote sets with upper-case letters, like $A, B, C, \ldots$, and their elements with lower-case letters, such as $a, b, c, \ldots$. We use the symbol $\in$ to denote that an object is an element of a set. For example, $a \in A$ means that object $a$ is element of set $A$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For two elements $x$ and $y$ of a set $A$, we can ask whether or not they're equal. If they are, we denote this as $x = y$. If they're not, we denote this as $x \neq y$. $=$ is called the <b>identity relation</b> on $A$ and has three key properties:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>It is reflexive: for any $x \in A$, we have $x = x$;</li>
		<li>It is transitive: for any three $x,y,z \in A$, if $x = y$ and $y = z$, then $x = z$;</li>
		<li>It is symmetric: for any two $x,y \in A$, if $x = y$, then $y = x$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		For example, in the set $\NN$ of natural numbers, since $2+2$ is equal to $4$, by symmetry, $4$ is also equal to $2+2$. Besides elements and an identity relation, sets have no additional structure.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the following chapters, we use a bold $\mathbf{n}$ to denote an $n$ element set and we denote its elements by $0_{\mathbf{n}}, \ldots, (n-1)_{\mathbf{n}}$. We use $\varnothing = \mathbf{0}$ to denote the empty set and $! = 0_{\mathbf{1}}$ as an alternative notation of the unique element of the one element set. We use $\NN$ to denote the set of natural numbers, and $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ are its elements. These will be our main examples of sets.
	</p>

	<p>
		In logic, we often use quantifier symbols for statements such as "for all x, statement P holds" or "there exists a y for which statement Q holds", wherein we use a variable such as x or y to range over different values, instead of having a fixed value that the statement depends on. The symbol $\forall$ is used for the universal quantifier. The statement $\forall x.P$ means "for all x, statement P holds". The variable $x$ is placed immediately to the right of the $\forall$, and the quantifier and $P$ are separated with a dot. We also often bound variables to be of a certain set or type, or quantify over multiple variables at once. For example, $\forall x,y \in A, b \in B. \ldots$ means "for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$ and all $b$ in $B$, â€¦". Another common quantifier is $\exists$, which means "there exists". It is used in the same way as $\forall$, but to mean "there exists" instead of "forall". The axiom of transitivity of identity can thus be stated as
	</p>
\[\forall x,y,z \in A. x = y \wedge y = z \implies x = z\]
	<p>
		(the symbols $\wedge$ and $\implies$ mean "and" and "implies" respectively)
	</p>


	<h2>Functions</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>function</b> $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ assigns, to each element $a \in A$, some element $f(a) \in B$. Here, $a$ is called the <b>argument</b> of the function and $f(a)$ is the function <b>value</b> (at $a$).
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>This assignment must be <i>total</i>, meaning that $f$ has a value at <i>every</i> element of $A$;</li>
		<li>This assignment must be <i>unique</i>, meaning that $f$ cannot have multiple function values at the same argument (if $a = b$, then $f(a) = f(b)$).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Two functions $f$ and $g$, both from $A$ to $B$, are equal if $f(a) = g(a)$ for all $a \in A$. This means that, besides the function values, functions do not contain any extra information, such as the exact procedure to derive those values.
	</p>

	<p>
		We write $f: A \to B$ to denote that $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$. The set $A$ is called the <b>domain</b> of the function $f$ and $B$ is called the <b>codomain</b>. To indicate that the function $f$ maps an object $a \in A$ to an object $b \in B$, we use the symbol $\mapsto$, as in $a \mapsto b$ (when $f$ is clear from context) or $f: a \mapsto b$. We'll often write the following:
	</p>
\[\begin{array}{rrcl}
f: & A & \to & B \\
& a & \mapsto & f(a)
\end{array}\]
	<p>
		to declare a function $f$. The variable $a$ in the declaration is called a <b>parameter</b> of $f$. This notation should make it clear if we're using a notation other than $f(a)$ to denote the function value. For example, if we write
	</p>
\[\begin{array}{rrcl}
(-)^*: & A & \to & A \\
& a & \mapsto & a^*
\end{array}\]
	<p>
		then it should be clear the function value of the function $(-)^*$ applied to the parameter $a$ is denoted as $a^*$, rather than $(-)^*(a)$.
	</p>

	<p>
		We often visualize functions like this:
	</p>

	<p>
		The left (red) blobs are elements of the domain of the function, and the right (orange) blobs are elements of the codomain. The blue lines indicate which element maps to which element: the first two red blobs get mapped to the second orange blob, and the third gets mapped to the third. As can be seen in the picture above, each red blob has a unique corresponding orange blob. The same does not hold for the orange blobs. For example, the first orange blob has no corresponding red blob, and the second orange blob has multiple corresponding red blobs.
	</p>

	<p>
		A common operation on functions is function composition. If we have functions $f$ from $A$ to $B$ and $g$ from $B$ to $C$, then we can define a composite function $g \circ f$ (read: "$g$ follows $f$") from $A$ to $C$ that maps $a \in A$ to $g(f(a))$. Note that the composition $g \circ f$ is sort-of denoted right-to-left: $f$ should be applied first, <i>then</i> $g$. This is to make it consistent with the notation $g(f(a))$, where $g$ is also written to the left of $f$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, suppose we have the following two functions

		One from red to orange, the other from orange to yellow. If we want to compute the function value of the composite function at a red blob, we follow one blue line form red to orange, and then the next blue line from orange to yellow, and the yellow blob we arrive at is our function value. If we do that for all red blobs, we get the following composite function:

	<p>
		One (fairly obvious) property of composition is associativity: if we have three functions $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$ and $h: C \to D$ which we want to compose into one function $h \circ g \circ f$, it doesn't matter if we first compose $h$ with $g$, and compose the result with $f$, or if we first compose $g$ and $f$, and then compose the result of that with $h$. In both cases, we map $a$ to $h(g(f(a)))$. Thus, instead of writing $(h \circ g) \circ f$ or $h \circ (g \circ f)$, we can simply write $h \circ g \circ f$, omitting the parenthesis.
	</p>

	<p>
		A rather trivial example of a function is the identity function. Given a set $A$, the identity function on $A$ is denoted $\id_A$. The domain and codomain of $\id_A$ are both $A$ and, for $a \in A$, $\id_A(a)$ is defined as just $a$. The identity function is a neutral element for function composition: given a function $f: A \to B$, or $g: B \to A$, composing it with $\id_A$ gives back the same function. For $a \in A$, $(f \circ \id_A)(a) = f(\id_A(a)) = f(a)$ and for $b \in B$, $(\id_A \circ g)(b) = \id_A(g(b)) = g(b)$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For every set $A$, there is a unique function $\mathbf{0} \to A$. Namely, the empty function (of $A$). Since $\mathbf{0}$ has no elements, the empty function doesn't need to be defined on any arguments. As for functions $A \to \mathbf{0}$, there are usually none. There are no elements that the elements of $A$ can be mapped to, so no function from $A$ to $\mathbf{0}$ can be defined. The one exception is (of course) $A = \mathbf{0}$, as then we don't have elements of $A$ to worry about.
	</p>

	<p>
		For every set $A$, there also is a unique function $A \to \mathbf{1}$. If we try to define a function from $A$ to $\mathbf{1}$, we are forced to map every element of $A$ to $!$. There is a natural correspondence between functions $\mathbf{1} \to A$ and elements of $A$: a function $f: \mathbf{1} \to A$ corresponds to the element $f(!) \in A$ and, given an element $a \in A$, we can construct a function $f: \mathbf{1} \to A$ by defining $f: {!} \mapsto a$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For functions $f: A \to A$, whose domain is equal to its codomain, we can compose it with itself. We write repeated composition as $f^{\circ n}$ or simply $f^n$. For example, $f^{\circ 3} = f \circ f \circ f$. A function $f: A \to A$ for which $f^2 = f$ (i.e. for which applying twice is the same as applying once) is called an <i>idempotent</i> function. If $f^2 = \id_A$, we call it an <i>involution</i>. Taking an inverse or negative is a common example of an involution. We'll explore more kinds of functions (injections, surjections, bijections, permutations) in the following sections. Functions that have the same domain as codomain are sometimes called operators, though this term more often refers to multi-argument functions on a single set. Endofunction is also a term that can be used to describe an $A \to A$ function, but this term is not used that often. Instead of drawing two sets and lines between them, with endofunctions, we can draw one set and draw arrows between the elements of the sets to visualize the function, like so:

		The top blob gets send to the right blob, and the right blob and bottom blob get send to the top blob. The left blob is mapped to itself.
	</p>


	<h2>Injections</h2>
	<p>
		Some of the most important kinds of functions are injections, surjections and bijections.
	</p>

	<p>
		For sets $A$ and $B$, an <b>injection</b> from $A$ to $B$ is a function $f: A \to B$ for which, for all $x,y \in A$, if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x = y$. This is not true for functions in general: a function can map different arguments to the same value. We use the symbols $\rightarrowtail$ or $\hookrightarrow$ to indicate a function is an injection, as in $f: A \hookrightarrow B$. An injection is also sometimes called an embedding or an inclusion of $A$ in $B$, as it gives the elements of $A$ an interpretation as elements of $B$. This way, $A$ can be seen as a subset of $B$. The identity relation on subsets (which I won't explain right now) might be a bit unintuitive. I aim to explain more about subsets in chapter 2. It is not always possible to define an injection from one given set to another. For example, there is no injection from $\mathbf{3}$ to $\mathbf{2}$.
	</p>

	<p>
		An exmaple of an injection is the function $n \mapsto n^2$ defined on natural numbers, that sends each number to its square. When seeing this as an inclusion, we identify natural numbers in the domain with their squares in the codomain. This way, it seems that the codomain of the injection is larger, as not all natural numbers in the codomain are perfect squares (e.g. $3$), and therefore not mapped to. However, we know the domain and codomain are the same: they are both the set of natural numbers. We can thus identify the set of perfect squares with the set of natural numbers, but at the same time, this identification is not the usual one (i.e. not the identity function). So does the set of perfect squares have the same size as the set of natural numbers, or is it smaller?
	</p>

	<p>
		Up to the late 19th century, mathematicians said that these two sets have the same size as they're both infinite. This makes sense, as we can identify elements of one set with elements of the other. However, in 1874, mathematician Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor found that knowing that two sets are infinite isn't enough to prove they can be paired one-to-one. Specifically, in a letter to Dedekind he wrote a proof that showed the set of positive real numbers cannot be enumerated by natural numbers. Although the set of natural numbers and the set of perfect squares can be thought of as having the same size, this isn't true anymore for any two infinite sets.
	</p>

	<p>
		A set $A$ for which there exists an injection $f: A \hookrightarrow A$ that doesn't map to every element of $A$ (like the $n \mapsto n^2$ function) is called a <i>Dedekind infinite</i> set. This is equivalent to there being an inclusion $g: \NN \hookrightarrow A$. Given an element $a \in A$ that is not mapped onto by $f$, we know that $f(a) \neq a$, but also, $f(f(a)) \neq f(a)$, as otherwise two distinct elements map to $f(a)$ ($a$ and $f(a)$), and $f(f(a)) \neq a$, as we assumed $a$ is not mapped onto. We can continue this, showing that $f^m(a) \neq f^n(a)$ whenever $m \neq n$, and so we can define the inclusion $g: \NN \hookrightarrow A$ by $g(n) = f^n(a)$. And, given an inclusion $g: \NN \hookrightarrow A$, we can define the injection $f: A \hookrightarrow A$ by $f(a) = a$ if $g$ does not map onto $a$, and $f(g(n)) = g(n+1)$ otherwise. Thus, we snake the inclusion of $\NN$ in $A$ one step foreward. This way, $g(0)$ is not mapped to by $f$. Dedekind infinite sets might come back in later chapters.
	</p>


	<h2>Surjections</h2>
	<p>
		For sets $A$ and $B$, a <b>surjection</b> from $A$ onto $B$ is a function $f: A \to B$ for which $\forall b \in B. \exists a \in A. f(a) = b$ (all elements of $B$ are mapped to by some element of $A$). We use $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$ to denote $f$ is a surjection from $A$ onto $B$. For an element $b$ of $B$, we call the subset of elements $a \in A$ that map onto $b$ (for which $f(a) = b$) the <i>fibre</i> of $b$ under $f$, and we denote it as $f^{-1}\{b\}$. To quickly explain the notation: ${}^{-1}$ means "inverse image" and $\{b\}$ means "the set of only $b$", so $f^{-1}\{b\}$ is the "inverse image of the set of only $b$". It's clear to see, then, that a function is a surjection exactly when all its fibers are non-empty. Dually, a function is injective when all its fibres have at most one element. If we think of $A$ as some ambient set and $B$ as a set of indices or labels, a surjection $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$ can then be thought of as a (labelled) partition of $A$ into non-empty subsets (namely, the fibres), each labelled, or indexed, by an element of $B$.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Another way to think of a surjection is as some sort of quotient map: the set $B$ results from the set $A$ by making the identity relation ($=$) on it weaker, thus identifying more elements of $A$ with eachother. The surjection then gives an interpretation of each element of $A$ as an element of $B$. This is a bit confusing to think about, so I'll try to give an example. The set $A$ is the set of all line segments in the plane. In $A$, the line segment from point $(0,1)$ to point $(1,2)$ and the line segment from point $(-4,3)$ to point $(-5,2)$ are different line segments, as different points lie on each. In $B$, elements are still line segments, but this time we identify two line segments with eachother if they have the same length. Now, the two line segments are equal, as they both have length $\sqrt{2}$. The quotient map $q: A \twoheadrightarrow B$ thus sends each line-segment in $A$ to its 'length' in $B$, where more line segments are identified with (i.e. equal to) eachother. The set $B$ is called a <i>quotient</i>, as it results from factoring out the differences in position and orientation of line segments (i.e. we ignore these properties of line segments). I hope this example makes sense.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a surjection $f: A \to B$, a <b>section</b> of $f$ is a function $s: B \to A$ that chooses, for each element $b \in B$, some element $a \in A$ in the fibre of $b$. Thus, $s$ is a section if $f \circ s = \id_B$ (make sure you understand this equation). It's not too difficult to prove all sections are injections (try it yourself!). Some surjections have obvious sections. For example, if we have a function $f: \NN \to \mathbf{2}$ that maps even numbers to $0_{\mathbf{2}}$ and odd numbers to $1_{\mathbf{2}}$, then one example of a section maps $0_{\mathbf{2}}$ to the even number $4$ and $1_{\mathbf{2}}$ to the odd number $11$. We can also define a section of any function $f: \NN \to B$ out of the natural numbers by mapping each element of $B$ to the smallest natural number in its fibre. For some (a bit more complicated) surjections, finding a section is less obvious.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, we can define a function $f$ that takes as argument a pair $(X,x)$ with a set $X$ of real numbers ($X$ is a subset of the set $\mathbb{R}$ of all real numbers) and an element $x$ of that set, and maps that pair to the set $X$. The domain of this function is $\sum_{X \subseteq \mathbb{R}} X$ and the codomain is $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) \smallsetminus \varnothing$, don't worry about the notation too much for now, all will be explained in due time. If we want to find a section of this mapping, for each non-empty set $X$ of real numbers, we want to pick one real number out of it. We might first try to choose the smallest real number in the set, but not all sets of real numbers have a smallest element. For example, although $0$ seems like it's the smallest element of the open interval from $0$ to $1$, this interval doesn't actually contain $0$, so we cannot choose it. We can also try to pick the middle element, but again, some sets don't have a middle element. For any way we try to describe a section, no matter how clever, it won't work.

		The axiom of choice, abbreviated as AC, states that every surjection has a section. We don't need to describe this section, this axiom just gives us one. This axiom is used a lot in modern mathematics. We will not assume it by default: if we want to show a surjection has a section, an explicit construction of that section must be given. We will expand more on AC in future chapters.

	<p>
		A retraction of an injection is analogous to a section of a surjection: $r$ is a retraction of $f$ if $r \circ f = \id_A$. Retractions are boring and you may forget about them immediately.

	<h2>Bijections</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>bijection</b> from $A$ to $B$ is a function $f: A \to B$ that is both an injection and a surjection. A fibre of an injection always has at most one element, and fibres of surjections have at least one element, so fibres of bijections have exactly one element. Another way to state $f$ is bijective is by the existence of a function $g: B \to A$ for which $g \circ f = \id_A$ and $f \circ g = \id_B$. $g$ simply chooses the unique element in each fibre of $f$. Such a $g$ is called the <i>inverse</i> of $f$, and is often denoted $f^{-1}$. Bijections are a one-to-one correspondence of the elements of $A$ and $B$, so it can be thought of as an equivalence of those two sets. There are different symbols that can be used to denote a function is a bijection, we'll use $\leftrightarrow$.
	</p>

	<p>
		A bijection $f: A \leftrightarrow A$ is called a <b>permutation</b>. Although the existence of a bijection $A \leftrightarrow B$ implies $A$ and $B$ are indistinguishable/equivalent, there are often multiple choises for what this equivalence is, and it's not clear which one to choose. In the case of $A \leftrightarrow A$, there is a clear cannonical equivalence: $\id_A$. We are often interested in how a given permutation compares to the identity permutation. The collection of all permutations of a set $A$ forms a group (we can compose and invert permutations and there is a neutral permutation), called the permutation group of $A$. This group is denoted $S_A$.

	<h2>Images</h2>
	<p>
		We can factorize any function $f: A \to B$ into a surjection $s: A \twoheadrightarrow \im(f)$ and an injection $i: \im(f) \hookrightarrow B$ (so that $i \circ s = f$). The set $\im(f)$ is called the <b>image</b> of $f$ and is the set of all elements of $B$ that $f$ maps to. The injection $i$ is the inclusion of this image in entire codomain $B$. The set $\im(f)$ can also be thought of as a quotient of $A$ where we identify two elements of $A$ with eachother if $f$ maps them to the same element in $B$, and $s$ is then the quotient map. Or you can think like a normal person, in which case, $s$ is just the function $f$ but with the codomain minimized.

		Any such factorization is unique in the sense that, for every set $C$ and any pair of functions $g: A \twoheadrightarrow C$ and $h: C \hookrightarrow B$ where $g$ is surjective, $h$ is injective and $h \circ g = f$, there exists a bijection $b: \im(f) \leftrightarrow C$ for which $b \circ s = g$ and $h \circ b = i$. Moreover, this bijection is unique. We define $b(x)$ by first looking at where $i$ maps $x$ to in $B$, and then tracing back via $h$ to $C$. The function $h$ is only injective, not (necessarily) bijective, so we want to verify we can trace back $i(x)$ to $C$ with it. Thus, that $h$ maps some element of $C$ to $i(x)$. This is because $f$ maps some element $a \in A$ to $i(x)$ ($s$ is surjective, so it must map some element $a$ to $x$, and, by $f = i \circ s$, $f$ maps that same element to $i(x)$), and $f(a) = h(g(a))$, and so we can trace $i(x)$ in $B$ back to $g(a)$ in $C$. With this definition, we have $h \circ b = i$. If we want $h \circ b = i$, this definition is forced, so if $b$ works we already know it's unique. Next we want to verify that $b \circ s = g$, i.e. that $b(s(a)) = g(a)$ for $a \in A$. By assumption, $h$ is injective, and if two function values of an injection are equal, then the two arguments must be equal as well. We already know that $h(b(s(a))) = i(s(a)) = f(a)$, and $h(g(a)) = f(a)$ directly follows from the assumption $h \circ g = f$. Therefore, $b \circ s = g$ as desired.
