	<h1>Sets and Functions</h1>
	<h2>Sets</h2>
	<p>
		In mathematics, a set refers to any collection of objects. For example, there is a set of natural numbers $\NN$, a set of all people on earth, a set with no elements, and a set consisting of a triangle, the colour red and a sheep named Gregory. Sets are often denoted with curly braces $\{\cdots\}$ with the contents of the set between them. So, for example, the last set listed is denoted as $\{\triangle, {\color{myred}\textrm{red}}, \textrm{Gregory the sheep}\}$. We'll denote sets with upper-case letters, like $\xA, \xB, \xC, \ldots$, and their elements with lower-case letters, such as $\xa, \xb, \xc, \ldots$. We use the symbol $\in$ to denote that an object is an element of a set. For example, $\xa \in \xA$ means that object $\xa$ is element of set $\xA$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For two elements $\xx$ and $\xy$ of a set $\xA$, we can ask whether or not they're equal. If they are, we denote this as $\xx = \xy$. If they're not, we denote this as $\xx \neq \xy$. $=$ is called the <i>identity relation</i> on $\xA$ and has three key properties:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>It is reflexive: for any $\xx \in \xA$, we have $\xx = \xx$;</li>
		<li>It is transitive: for any three $\xx,\xy,\xz \in \xA$, if $\xx = \xy$ and $\xy = \xz$, then $\xx = \xz$;</li>
		<li>It is symmetric: for two $\xx,\xy \in \xA$, if $\xx = \xy$, then $\xy = \xx$.</li>
	</ul>

	For example, in the set $\NN$ of natural numbers, since $2+2$ is equal to $4$, by symmetry, $4$ is also equal to $2+2$. Besides elements and an identity relation, sets have no additional structure.

	In the following chapters, we use a bold $\mathbf{n}$ to denote an $n$ element and we denote its elements with $0_{\mathbf{n}}, \ldots, (n-1)_{\mathbf{n}}$. We use $\emptyset$ to denote the empty set and $\bang = 0_{\mathbf{1}}$ for an alternative notation of the unique element of the one element set $\mathbf{1}$. We use $\NN$ to denote the set of natural numbers, and $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ are its elements. These will be our main examples of sets.
