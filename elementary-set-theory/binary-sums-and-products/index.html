	<h1>Binary Sums and Products</h1>
	<h2>Products</h2>
	<p>
		Any two given sets $A$ and $B$ have a <b>product</b>, which consists of:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A set $A \times B$, also sometimes refered to as the product;</li>
		<li>Functions $A \times B \to A$ and $A \times B \to B$, called <b>projections</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The set $A \times B$ consists of all pairs of elements $(a,b)$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. For example, $(6,(3,44))$ is an element of $\NN \times (\NN \times \NN)$. The projection functions make clear how $A \times B$ relates to $A$ and $B$.
	</p>
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
\pi_0: & A \times B & \to & A \\
& p & \mapsto & p_0 \\
\pi_1: & A \times B & \to & B \\
& p & \mapsto & p_1
\end{array}
\]
	<p>
		We'll denote these projections by $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, or sometimes $\pi_0^{A \times B}$ and $\pi_1^{A \times B}$ to indicate which project they're the projection functions of. We call $\pi_0$ the <b>left projection</b> and $\pi_1$ the <b>right projection</b>. The left projection chooses $a$ from a pair $(a,b)$ and the right projection chooses $b$ from a pair $b$. For a pair $p$, we write the left- and right projection of $p$ as $p_0$ and $p_1$ respectively. For example, $((6,(3,44))_1)_0 = (3,44)_0 = 3$.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are three basic axioms regarding the pair construction $(-,-)$ and the projections $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>For $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, $(a,b)_0 = a$;</li>
		<li>For $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, $(a,b)_1 = b$;</li>
		<li>For $p \in A \times B$, $(p_0,p_1) = p$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The first two axioms are basically just the definitions of the two projections. The last axiom might be a bit confusing at first. Basically, it states that no pair contains more information than its left and right projection, similar to how a function contains no more information than its function values. In other words, closer to the actual statement of the axiom, all pairs $p \in A \times B$ can be constructed with the same pair construction $(-,-)$. Without it, there might be multiple pairs $p \neq p'$ with $p_0 = p'_0$ and $p_1 = p'_1$.
	</p>

	<p>
		When we write a ternary product like $A \times B \times C$, it's unclear whether we mean $(A \times B) \times C$ or $A \times (B \times C)$. Products don't seem to be associative at first: the first projection function of $(A \times B) \times C$ is an $(A \times B) \times C \to A \times B$ function, while the first projection function of $A \times (B \times C)$ is from $A \times (B \times C)$ to $A$. So it's not clear which one we should choose as the correct interpretation. However, the underlying set doesn't actually seem to change, only the projection functions around it. From the set $A \times B \times C$ of triplets $(a,b,c)$ for $a \in A$, $b \in B$ and $c \in C$, we can define a left projection $\pi_0^{(A \times B) \times C}: A \times B \times C \to A \times B$ that maps $(a,b,c)$ to $(a,b)$, or we can define a left projection $\pi_0^{A \times (B \times C)}: A \times B \times C \to A$ that maps $(a,b,c)$ to $a$. But we still want to know which projection function to use when interpreting $(a,b,c)_0$.
	</p>

	<p>
		Neither option is really practical. If we haver longer tuples $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$, we have to apply a lot of projection functions to get to an element somewhere in the middle. So, instead of choosing either, we'll just use more projection functions $\pi_0: A \times B \times C \to A$, $\pi_1: A \times B \times C \to B$ and $\pi_2: A \times B \times C \to C$, where $(a,b,c)_0 = a$, $(a,b,c)_1 = b$ and $(a,b,c)_2 = c$. Generally, $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)_i = a_i$. In cases where the exact choice does matter, for example if a theorem or definition applies specifically to binary products, we assume $\times$ is right-associative, meaning that $A \times B \times C = A \times (B \times C)$.

	<h2>Multi-Valued Functions</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>multi-valued</b> function is a function whose codomain is a product. If the codomain of a function $f$ is a product of $n$ sets we call it an $n$-valued function. For example, the function
	</p>
\[
\begin{array}{rrcl}
\Delta_A: & A & \to & A \times A \\
& a & \mapsto & \Delta_A(a)
\end{array}
\]
	<p>
		defined by $\Delta_A(a) = (a,a)$, called the <b>diagonal</b> of $A$, is a two-valued function. We often omit $A$ when writing the diagonal map, simply denoting it as $\Delta$. Another example is the function $f: \NN \to \NN \times \NN$ that factors $n$ into $(a,b)$, where $n = a \cdot b^2$ and $a$ is a square-free number. For example, $f(12) = (3,2)$ as $12 = 3 \cdot 2^2$ and $3$ is square-free.
	</p>

	<p>
		It seems like a multi-valued function really is just multiple functions in one. For example the function $f$ that factors a number into a square-free part and a square can be seen as two functions $g: \NN \to \NN$ and $h: \NN \to \NN$, where $g$ maps a number to its square-free part, and $h$ maps a number to (the square-root of) the square part. Thus, $g(12) = 3 = f(12)_0$ and $h(12) = 2 = f(12)_1$. Since pairs are uniquely determined by its projections (because of the third axiom of pairs), we can give a complete definition of a multi-valued function by defining only the projections of its function values. For example,
	</p>
\begin{eqnarray}
k(n)_0 & = & n + 6 \\
k(n)_1 & = & 2 \cdot n \\
k(n)_2 & = & n^3
\end{eqnarray}
	<p>
		is a complete definition of a function $k: \NN \to \NN \times \NN \times \NN$.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a list of functions $f_0: A \to B_0, \ldots, f_n: A \to B_n$, each with the same domain, we call the unique multi-valued function $f: A \to B_0 \times \cdots \times B_n$  for which, for all $0 \le i \le n$, $\pi_i \circ f = f_i$, the <b>tuple</b> of $f_0, \ldots, f_n$. We denote this tuple as $(f_0,\ldots,f_n)$. Using the square-factoring example above, we thus have $f = (g,h)$. Tuples of functions share notation with pairs and tuples of elements. This is because they're basically the same thing. We'll often use a pair $(g,h)$ as both a function tuple as a pair of elements, so we write $(g,h)_0$ to mean $g$ (using $(g,h)$ as a pair of elements, this can also be interpreted as a shorthand for $\pi_0 \circ (g,h)$) and $(g,h)(n)$ to mean $(g(n),h(n))$ (using $(g,h)$ as a tuple of functions).
	</p>

	<p>
		One last example of a multi-valued function is the bijection between $A \times B$ and $B \times A$ that maps a pair $(a,b)$ to $(b,a)$. Using function tuples, this bijection can be written as $(\pi_1,\pi_0)$.
	</p>


	<h2>Functions with Multiple Arguments</h2>
	<p>
		A function a product of $n$ sets as domain is called an <b>$n$-ary</b> function (binary for $n=2$, ternary for $n=3$, etc). For $f: A_0 \times \cdots \times A_{n-1} \to B$, we write $f$ applied to the tuple $(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ as $f(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ and we call the elements $a_0 \in A_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} \in A_{n-1}$ its <b>arguments</b>. Unlike multi-valued functions, $n$-ary functions aren't simply multiple functions in one.
	</p>

	<p>
		We already saw a binary function in the last chapter: the bijection $(\pi_1,\pi_0)$. W.I.P
