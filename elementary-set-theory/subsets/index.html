	<h1>Subsets</h1>
	<h2>Subsets</h2>
	<p>
		Given a set $X$, a subset of $X$ is a set that contains some, but (often) not all the elements of $X$. For example, the set $E$ of even natural numbers is a subset of the set $\NN$ of all natural numbers. When viewing the set $E$ in isolation, however, it's not clear that it's a subset of $\NN$ or which elements of $\NN$ it contains. In fact, the set $E$ seems identical to $\NN$ as there is a bijection $n \mapsto \frac{n}{2}$ between the two sets. We need some way to realize the elements of $E$ as elements of $\NN$. This is done with an injection $m: E \hookrightarrow \NN$ serving as an inclusion of $E$ in $\NN$, mapping every even number $n \in E$ to its corresponding natural number in $\NN$, allowing us to compare elements of $E$ with elements of $\NN$. We can thus define a subset of $X$ to be a pair $(A,m)$ consisting of a set $A$ and an inclusion $m: A \hookrightarrow X$. We write $A \subset X$ (sometimes $A \subseteq X$) to denote $A$ is a subset of $X$, the inclusion $m$ is omitted in the notation as it's often clear from context. In this chapter, I'll often write $(A,m) \subset X$ instead. For $x \in X$, we write $x \in A$ for "$x$ is in the subset $A$" or, formally, $\exists a \in A. m(a) = x$, and we write $x \notin A$ for "$x$ is not in the subset $A$", which is simply the negation of $x \in A$.

	<p>
		We can also identify the set of even numbers with $\NN$ itself and the inclusion $n \mapsto 2n$. Or we could define a different inclusion, such as
	</p>
\[\left\{\begin{array}{lll}
2n & \mapsto & 4n+2 \\
2n+1 & \mapsto & 4n
\end{array}\right.\]
	<p>
		which swaps each consecutive pair of even numbers. Besides these all being different sets and/or different inclusion, they all still represent the same subset of $\NN$: the set of even numbers. The definition of subsets we have is thus incomplete: it only says what a subset <i>is</i>, but not yet when two subsets are <i>equal</i>. The definition of the identity relation on subsets is as follows:
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a set $X$ and subsets $(A,m) \subset X$ and $(B,n) \subset X$, we have that $(A,m)$ and $(B,n)$ are <b>identical</b> (or <i>equal</i>) if there is a bijection $f: A \leftrightarrow B$ for which $n = m \circ f$.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the latter two representations of the set of even numbers are identical because of the bijection
	</p>
\[\left\{\begin{array}{lll}
2n & \mapsto & 2n+1 \\
2n+1 & \mapsto & 2n
\end{array}\right.\]
	<p>
		It can be shown that, if two subsets are equal, then they're equal in a unique way. In other words, given $X$, $(A,m) \subset X$, $(B,n) \subset X$, $f: A \leftrightarrow B$ and $g: A \leftrightarrow B$ for which $n = m \circ f$ and $n = m \circ g$, we have that $f = g$. We use function extensionality to prove this: given $a \in A$, we have that $m(f(a)) = n(a) = m(g(a))$, and therefore $m(f(a)) = m(g(a))$. Since $m$ is an injection, we have that $f(a) = g(a)$, which is exactly what we wanted to show.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's also possible for sets to be subsets of other subsets. For example, the set of $2$ and $6$ as a subset of the set of natural numbers, is a subset of the set of even numbers: every element of $\{2,6\}$, realized as an element of $\NN$, is also an element of $E$. This is equivalent to saying that there is an inclusion $i$ of $\{2,6\}$ in $E$ that "respects" the inclusions $m: E \hookrightarrow \NN$ and $n: \{2,6\} \hookrightarrow \NN$, i.e. for which $m \circ i = n$. For $(A,m) \subset X$ and $(B,n) \subset X$, we can thus define the proposition $A \subset B$ to mean that there exists an injection $i: A \hookrightarrow B$ for which $m \circ i = n$. The reader may verify that such an injection $i$, if it exists, must be unique. From this definition, we have that $(A,m)$ and $(B,n)$ are identical as subsets of $X$ exactly when both $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$.
	</p>


	<h2>Predicates</h2>
	<p>
		If we have some rule for which elements belong to a subset and which don't, it's often difficult or sometimes just tedious to find a set $A$ and inclusion $m$ that selects exactly those elements that satisfy the given rule. For example, in the last section, if we don't have the set of even numbers $E$, we have to first identify that there are as many even numbers as natural numbers and then define an inclusion $\NN \hookrightarrow \NN$ that selects exactly the even numbers, such as $n \mapsto 2n$. Though it's not that difficult in this specific example, you can see it gets more difficult if you try to define the set of real-valued continuous functions as a subset of the set of all real-valued functions, which is still somewhat do-able with an inclusion from $\RR$, or the set of perfect numbers as a subset of $\NN$, for which we don't know how many there are and thus don't know which set we should choose as the domain of our inclusion. Because of this, there is an axiom in set theory, called the axiom of separation, which (roughly) states that every rule that selects elements of a set directly corresponds to some subset of that set.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use $\Omega$ to denote the set of truth-values $\{\top, \bot\}$ ($\top$ = true, $\bot$ = false). A "rule" is then a function $P: X \to \Omega$ that maps each element $x \in X$ to either $\top$ or $\bot$. We call such a function a <b>predicate</b> on $X$. Since elements of $\Omega$ are truth-values, we can use the function value $P(x)$ as a proposition in a longer formula, as in $\forall x \in X. P(x)$, which states that $P(x)$ is true for all $x \in X$. The axiom of separation then states that, given any predicate $P: X \to \Omega$, there is a subset $(A,m) \subset X$ for which, for all $x \in X$, $x \in A$ if and only if $P(x)$. We use the notation $\{x \in X \mid P(x)\}$, called set comprehension notation or set builder notation, to denote this subset. This axiom allows us to define the set $\{n \in \NN \mid n \textrm{ is prefect}\}$ of perfect numbers without knowing how many there are in advance. Sometimes we use a colon $:$ instead of a pipe $\mid$ to separate the element and the predicate in a set comprehension expression.
	</p>

	<p>
		In future chapters, we'll often identify predicates $P(x)$ with their corresponding subset $\{x \in X \mid P(x)\}$ and vice-versa. For now though, we'll keep them separate. It might make more sense to view the predicates on $X$ as the actual subsets, as two predicates $P,Q$ are equal as functions exactly when their corresponding subsets $\{x \in X \mid P(x)\}$ and $\{x \in X \mid Q(x)\}$ are equal as subsets.
	</p>

	<p>
		A predicate $R: A \times B \to \Omega$ on a Cartesian product $A \times B$ is called a <b>relation</b> between $A$ and $B$. For $(a,b) \in A \times B$, we often write $a R b$ for $R(a,b)$. We'll taker a closer look at relations in the chapter about quotients.
	</p>


	<h2>Unions, Intersections, Complements</h2>
	<p>
		Three basic operations on sets are (as the title of this section says) unions, intersections and complements. Given two subsets $A,B \subset X$, we define their union as follows:
	</p>
\[A \cup B = \{x \in X \mid x \in A \vee x \in B\}\]
	<p>
		Here, $\vee$ is the "or" symbol. A proposition of the form $P \vee Q$ is true if at least one of $P$ or $Q$ is true. The union of $A$ and $B$ thus contains all elements that are in either $A$ or in $B$ or both. In this picture, the two circles represent the two subsets $A$ and $B$ and the blue area is their union:

	</div>

	<p>
		 Unions of sets satisfy a few basic identities:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Union is associative: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$;</li>
		<li>Union is commutative: $A \cup B = B \cup A$;</li>
		<li>The empty set is neutral: $A \cup \varnothing = A = \varnothing \cup A$</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		$\varnothing$ denotes the empty subset of $X$. All of these identities should be fairly straightforeward: changing the order in which you take unions doesn't change what elements are in the union, and adding nothing to a subset doesn't change that subset.
	</p>

	<p>
		For subsets $A,B \subset X$, we say $A$ is a subset of $B$ (written $A \subset B$) if $\forall x \in X. x \in A \implies x \in B$. With this definition, we also have:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$A \subset A \cup B$;</li>
		<li>$B \subset A \cup B$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Furthermore, $A \cup B$ is a subset of any set $C$ satisfying the above two properties.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given two subsets $A,B \subset X$, we define their intersection as follows:
	</p>
\[A \cap B = \{x \in X \mid x \in A \wedge x \in B\}\]
	<p>
		Here, $\wedge$ is the "and" symbol. A proposition of the form $P \wedge Q$ is true if both $P$ and $Q$ are true. Thus, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ contains all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. The shaded area in this picture represents the intersection of $A$ and $B$:
	</p>

	</svg>
	</div>

	<p>
		Just like unions, intersections satisfy a few basic properties:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Intersection is associative: $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$;</li>
		<li>Intersection is commutative: $A \cap B = B \cap A$;</li>
		<li>The whole set $X$ is neutral: $A \cap X = A = X \cap A$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		$X \subset X$ is the set of all elements of $X$. We also have some identities for how unions and intersections interact:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Unions distribute over intersections: $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$;</li>
		<li>Intersections distribute over unions: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		It shouldn't be too hard to verify these identities for yourself.
	</p>

	<p>
		We also have the following:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$A \cap B \subset A$;</li>
		<li>$A \cap B \subset B$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In fact, any subset $C$ with the above two properties is a subset of $A$.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a subset $A \subset X$, we define its complement $A^c$ as follows:
	</p>
\[A^c = \{x \in X \mid x \notin A\}\]
	<p>
		In other words, it's the set of all elements of $X$ that are not in $A$. Unlike with unions and intersections, the ambient set $X$ now matters: if $X$ was a subset of a larger set $Y$ with an inclusion that respects those of $A$ and $B$, it didn't matter if we take the union of intersection of $A$ and $B$ in $X$ or in $Y$, but that does matter for complements. The blue area in this picture represents the complement of $A$ in $X$:
	</p>

	<div class="box">
	<svg width="300" height="300" style="background:var(--ctp-mocha-mauve)">
		<circle cx="150" cy="150" r="100" fill="var(--ctp-mocha-surface0)" filter="url(#shadow)"/>

	</svg>
	</div>

	<p>
		We have the following identities for how complements "distribute" over unions and intersections:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$;</li>
		<li>$(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These identities are called De Morgan laws. These identities should make sense intuitively: if something is in not in either $A$ or $B$, then it is neither in $A$ nor $B$, and if something is not in both $A$ and $B$, it's either not in $A$ or not in $B$. We also have the following identity, showing taking complements is an involution:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$A^{cc} = A$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		$A^c$ is the unique subset of $X$ that satisfies the following two identities:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$A^c \cup A = X$;</li>
		<li>$A^c \cap A = \varnothing$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If it's not clear what set the subset $A$ is should be considered the subset of when taking a complement, we write $X \setminus A$ for $A^c$ to clarify this. We can also define $B \setminus A$ for any two subsets $A,B \subset X$:
	</p>
\[B \setminus A = B \cap A^c = \{x \in X \mid x \in B \wedge x \notin A\}\]
	<p>
		The subset $B \setminus A$ is called the relative complement of $A$ relative to $B$. It looks like this:
	</p>

	<svg width="400" height="300">

		<circle cx="150" cy="150" r="100" fill="var(--ctp-mocha-surface0)"/>

	</svg>
	</div>

	<p>
		We can also define another operation $A \bigtriangleup B$, called the symmetric difference, as follows:
	</p>
\[A \bigtriangleup B = (B \setminus A) \cup (A \setminus B) = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)\]
	<p>
		This consists of all elements of $X$ that are in either $A$ or $B$, but not both. It can be used as a measure for how different two subsets are. For example, if $A \bigtriangleup B = \varnothing$, then $A$ and $B$ are the same subset.

	<h2>Function Restrictions</h2>
	<p>
		Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function and let $(A,m) \subset X$ be a subset. The <b>restriction</b> of $f$ to $A$ (along $m$) is commonly denoted $f|A$, $f|_A$, $f \upharpoonright A$ or $f{\upharpoonright_A}$. We'll use the notation $f|_A$. The restriction $f|_A$ is a function from $A$ to $Y$ representing the restriction of the function $f$ to the domain $A$. I.e. for $a \in A$, we have $f|_A(a) = f(a)$. Formally, it is defined by:
	</p>
\[f|_A = f \circ m\]
	<p>
		For $(A,m) \subset X$, $(B,n) \subset X$ and $f: X \to Y$, we have the following identities:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$f|_X = f$, where $X$ (with the inclusion $\id_X$) is the subset of all elements of $X$;</li>
		<li>$f|_\varnothing$ is the empty function to $Y$;</li>
		<li>Given that $A \subset B$ in $X$, witnessed by the inclusion $i: A \hookrightarrow B$, we have $(f|_B)|_A = f|_A$ (the first restriction to $A$ is along $i$, the second is along $m$);</li>
		<li>$\id_X|_A = m$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Given subsets $A \subset X$ and $B \subset X$ and functions $f: A \to Y$ and $g: B \to Y$, if $f|_{A \cap B} = g|_{A \cap B}$ (i.e. their values agree on their common domain), we can glue $f$ and $g$ together into a new function $f \cup g$. The union $f \cup g$ is a function from $A \cup B$ to $Y$ with the following two properties:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$(f \cup g)|_A = f$;</li>
		<li>$(f \cup g)|_B = g$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This function can be defined by cases as follows: $(f \cup g)(x) = f(x)$ if $x \in A \setminus B$, $(f \cup g)(x) = g(x)$ if $x \in B \setminus A$, and (either definition works) $(f \cup g)(x) = f(x)$ if $x \in A \cap B$ or, equivalently, $(f \cup g)(x) = g(x)$ if $x \in A \cap B$. A function from $A \cup B$ to $Y$ with the above two properties, if it exists, must be unique: suppose $h$ and $h'$ are such functions. We prove $h = h'$ using function extensionality. For $x \in A \cup B$, we have $x \in A$ or $x \in B$ (by definition of union). In the first case, i.e. if $x \in A$, we have that $h(x) = h|_A(x) = f(x) = h'|_A(x) = h'(x)$. In the second case, $h(x) = h|_B(x) = g(x) = h'|_B(x) = h'(x)$. In either case, $h(x) = h'(x)$.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given an operator $f: X^n \to X$ ($X^n = X \times \cdots \times X$ with $n$ copies of $X$), we say a subset $A \subset X$ is <b>closed</b> under the operator $f$ if for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in A$, we have that $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in A$ as well. In other words, the restriction $f|_{A^n}$ still makes sense as a function when we change the domain from $X$ to $A$. In yet other words, $\im(f) \subset A$. For example, consider the operation of addition on the natural numbers ${+}: \NN \times \NN \to \NN$. The set of even numbers is closed under this operation: if you add any two even numbers, you get an even number. However, the set of odd numbers is not closed under this operation: if we add, for example, $1$ and $5$, we get $6$, which is not in the set of odd numbers.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>closure</b> of a subset $A \subset X$ under an operation $f: X^n \to X$ is the unique subset $B \subset X$ with the following three properties:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$A \subset B$;</li>
		<li>$B$ is closed under $f$;</li>
		<li>For any subset $C \subset X$ with the above two properties, $B \subset C$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We can define this set $B$ as follows:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$B_0 = A$;</li>
		<li>For $i \in \NN$, $B_{i+1} = B_i \cup \im(f|_{B_i})$;</li>
		<li>$B = \{x \in X \mid \exists i \in \NN. x \in B_i\}$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		For example, the closure of the subset $\{3\} \subset \NN$ under addition is the set of all positive multiples of $3$.
	</p>


	<h2>Function Graphs</h2>
	<p>
		Given sets $A$ and $B$, a (binary) <b>relation</b> on $A$ and $B$ is a subset $R \subset A \times B$ of their product. For $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, we write $aRb$ for $(a,b) \in R$. For a function $f: A \to B$, its graph $\graph(f)$ is a relation on $A$ and $B$ defined as:
	</p>
\[a \graph(f) b \iff f(a) = b\]
	<p>
		We can see that the graph $R$ of a function always satisfies the following two condition:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>$\forall a \in A. \exists b \in B. aRb$;</li>
		<li>$\forall a \in A, b, b' \in B. aRb \wedge aRb' \implies b = b'$.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The first condition states that every element $a \in A$ is related to some element $b \in B$, and the second property states that this element $b$ is unique. Conversely, every relation satisfying the above two properties is the graph of some function. In most formal set theories, functions aren't given as a primitive concept. Instead, functions are identified by their graphs. This allows for more flexibility with functions: you can define partial functions and multi-valued functions easily, but this comes at the cost of not being able to call functions directly. Instead, if you want the function value of a function defined by the graph $R$ given the argument $a \in A$, you'd have to use a slightly awkward $\exists b \in B. aRb \wedge \cdots$ where $\cdots$ continuous your formula.

		Function graphs can be extended to graphs of $n$-ary and multi-argument functions quite easily: given a function $f: A_1 \times \cdots \times A_m \to B_1 \times \cdots \times B_n$, we can define its graph $\graph(f) \subset A_1 \times \cdots \times A_m \times B_1 \times \cdots \times B_n$ as:
	</p>
\[\graph(f)(a_1,\ldots,a_m,b_1,\ldots,b_m) \iff f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = (b_1,\ldots,b_n)\]
	<p>
		Given a relation $R \subset A \times B$, we write its inverse as $R^{-1}$. This is a relation on $B$ and $A$ defined by:
	</p>
\[bR^{-1}a \iff aRb\]
	<p>
		If $R$ is the graph of a bijection, then it can be verified that $R^{-1}$ is the graph of the inverse of that bijection. Thus, this notion of an inverse relation seems to match up with the notion of an inverse function.

		A relation $R \subset A \times B$ can have properties that make it look like a function or a certain kind of function. We use different notation for different kinds of relations. For example, we write $R: A \to B$ to denote $R$ satisfies the above two properties, thus signifying $R$ can be used as a usual function. Ohter properties of relations, and their notations, are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>$R: A \righttail B$ iff $\forall a \in A. \exists b \in B. aRb$;</li>
		<li>$R: A \rightharpoonup B$ iff $\forall a \in A, b, b' \in B. aRb \wedge aRb' \implies b = b'$ ($R$ is a partial function from $A$ to $B$).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If we have both $R: A \righttail B$ and $R: A \rightharpoonup B$, then $R$ is just the (graph of a) function. Then, an injection can be defined as a relation $R \subset A \times B$ for which $R: A \to B$ and $R^{-1}: B \rightharpoonup A$ and a surjection is a relation $R \subset A \times B$ for which $R: A \to B$ and $R^{-1}: B \righttail A$.
